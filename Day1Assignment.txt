1. What is your understanding of Blockchain?
A. Block chain is a distributed database i.e  same data is existed in different systems,and it is secured with cryptography.



2. What is the core problem blockchain trying to solve?
A. It solves of the problem of data security and trust by making ledger public with no middle men.



3. What are the few features which blockchain will give you?
A. -Decentralized technology
   -data Security
   -Verifiable
   -permanent data with no changes
   -distributed ledgers



4. What all things does a Block contain?
A. A block contains
	Block number
	Transaction records
	previous block signature
	Mining key



5. How is the verifiability of Blockchain is been attained?
A. Verifiability property is attained by the concept of distributed data base in blockchain.
   As same data is existed in different systems,whenever hash key is changed ,we can check if any data is changed by comparing 
   any data is changed by comparing the data with data in other's systems.In this way we can verify our data any time.
